### Grading criteria

The tentative grading breakdown is as follows:

- Quizzes (10%)
- Homework assignments (50%)
- Final project (40%)

***

### Late policy

Each student is allowed three late days total across all homework submissions. Once these three days are used, no additional late submissions will be accepted. If you encounter an unexpected health or personal emergency, please contact the instructors as soon as possible at <a href="mailto:cs4804instructors@gmail.com" target="_blank">cs4804instructors@gmail.com</a>, and provide valid documentation if needed. Late submissions due to job interviews, other coursework, or non-emergency situations will not be excused, and extensions will not be granted.

***

### AI assistance policy

AI assistance is permitted for completing assignments, including homework, quizzes, projects, but not for exams (if any). However, if you use AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini, you must submit the prompts you used and describe how the AI contributed to your work. It is your responsibility to verify the AI-generated content for accuracy before submission.

***

### Student collaboration policy

For group projects, work must be completed solely by members of the group. Apart from group projects, students must independently complete their work. Sharing code or written materials with others is prohibited. However, discussing concepts, clarifying instructions, exploring problem-solving approaches, or seeking debugging advice (without sharing code) is encouraged. All external sources must be properly cited.

### Academic accommodations

Virginia Tech welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. The University promotes efforts to provide equal access and a culture of inclusion without altering the essential elements of coursework. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers that may be due to disability, including but not limited to, chronic medical conditions, Deaf or hard of hearing, learning disability, mental health, or vision impairment, please contact the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) (540-231-3788, <a href="mailto:ssd@vt.edu" target="_blank">ssd@vt.edu</a>, or visit <a href="https://ssd.vt.edu/">www.ssd.vt.edu</a>). If you have an SSD accommodation letter, please meet with us privately during office hours as early in the semester as possible to discuss implementing your accommodations. You must give us reasonable notice to implement your accommodations, which is generally 5 business days and 10 business days for final exams or project presentations.

If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let us know as soon as possible. Together we will develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course.

### Academic integrity statement

The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states:

"As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times.  I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."

Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code.

See  <a href="https://honorsystem.vt.edu/">additional information about the Honor Code</a>.

### VT principles of community statement

Virginia Tech is a public land-grant university, committed to teaching and learning, research, and outreach to the Commonwealth of Virginia, the nation, and the world community. Learning from the experiences that shape Virginia Tech as an institution, we acknowledge those aspects of our legacy that reflected bias and exclusion. Therefore, we adopt and practice the following principles as fundamental to our on-going efforts to increase access and inclusion and to create a community that nurtures learning and growth for all of its members:

- <b>We affirm</b> the inherent dignity and value of every person and strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual respect and understanding.
- <b>We affirm</b> the right of each person to express thoughts and opinions freely. We encourage open expression within a climate of civility, sensitivity, and mutual respect.
- <b>We affirm</b> the value of human diversity because it enriches our lives and the University. We acknowledge and respect our differences while affirming our common humanity.
- <b>We reject</b> all forms of prejudice and discrimination, including those based on age, color, disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, and veteran status. We take individual and collective responsibility for helping to eliminate bias and discrimination and for increasing our own understanding of these issues through education, training, and interaction with others.
- <b>We pledge</b> our collective commitment to these principles in the spirit of the Virginia Tech motto of Ut Prosim (<i>That I May Serve</i>).
